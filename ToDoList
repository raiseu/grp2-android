robotstatus:
- instead of toast msgs convert it to listview

reset button: (DONE)
- move the reset button 

Joystick:
- find a way to use it

pic of robot:
- change the pic


obstacles:
- check if we need pic of the bull's eye and stuff

tilt button:
- make it work!!!!


robot is going out of the map: (kinda done)
- maybe look into giving pop-up message when it goes out

backward button 
- does not give proper message


CHECK IF THE POSTITION NEEDS TO CHANGE WHEN THE ROBOT TURNS
- i.e currently coordinates are based off of bottom left cornor, so even if the robot faces south it takes the bottom left cornor.
